**What's My Weather?** is a simple yet elegant web application that lets users quickly check real-time weather conditions for any city in the world. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by the OpenWeather API.

**✨ Features**

🔍 City-based Search: Enter any city name to instantly view its current weather data.<br>
🌡️ Live Temperature: Displays the current temperature in Celsius using real-time API data.<br>
💧 Humidity & Wind Speed: Shows humidity levels and wind speed for better climate insight.<br>
🌥️ Weather Condition & Icon: Provides a short description (like “Clear Sky” or “Moderate Rain”) with a matching weather icon from OpenWeather.<br>
🧊 Responsive & Minimal UI: A soft, modern design using CSS grid and smooth box shadows for a clean, professional look.<br>
⚡ Error Handling: Informs the user if the city name is invalid or unavailable.<br>

<br>

**⚙️ How It Works**

The user enters a city name in the input box.<br>
On form submission, the app fetches data from the OpenWeather API.<br>
The API response is parsed, and details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition are extracted.<br>
The weather data is then displayed inside a responsive grid card with icons and descriptions.<br>

**💡 Inspiration**

This project was created as a lightweight, visually appealing way to learn API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), and responsive front-end design — all while making something genuinely useful and fun.
